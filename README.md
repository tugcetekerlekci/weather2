# weather2
My first repository on GitHub
this is my Weather application for specific city. 
mApp intends to contribute to solutions for the growing industrial need to design a reliable, innovative and a fun travel application. 
We developed an iOS Application for travelers. We thought that people need knowledge about the location they will visit before they go. 
They would like to learn weather, make a plan, and bring appropriate clothes. Even after they went to see a place they can use mApp to keep 
a journal, listen to music, play games, share their experiences on social media. Wikipedia is a cliché resource for this. We thought mApp 
could be an innovative way of accessing information. Thus, we started to learn Swift programming language to be able to develop the app.

Why did we want to develop mApp? 
	People need instant knowledge about the location that they will visit
  	Wikipedia is cliché, mApp is innovative 
	Travelers want to know what kind of clothes to bring with them
	Prior knowledge about the city they will travel is essential
	  They will be able to make plans beforehand
	Sharing their experiences with friends is fun!

Users can see the instant location using application and can get weather condition for this application. We considered this is crucial factor. Because if people would like to know the weather conditions to prepare their stuffs for the vacation. Moreover, users can get any useful information for their travel places. Users could connect to trip advisor, Wikipedia. We thought people love listening music during travels. For these reason, we added some song that user can listen during the trip.
